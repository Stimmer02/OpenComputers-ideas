# OpenComputers-ideas
A bunch of ideas around amazing Minecraft mod - OpenComputers. 

Programs are mostly inspired by HBM's Nuclear Tech mod. The second I read that those two mods are compatible I knew that I won't be able to resist the urge to build and program remote silos, bunkers, etc. But it all have started from my passion towards distributed systems - the idea that not all operations are being performed on one device and different tasks are being divided to different devices. There was one big problem. I couldn't afford to buy (and sustain) bunch of computers to be able to start learning process. One day I have found about this brilliant mod Computer Craft and later OpenComputers and their capabilities seemed just perfect to suit my needs.

This repo contains some of my creations. They are mostly dependent on each other so on their own they won't work. Most of them use Connection or SecureConnection class to communicate with other devices via "tunnel relay" creating network of star topology.
